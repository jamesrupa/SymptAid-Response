# SymptAid Response
**A Medical Java Application**\
*Created By James Rupa & Jonathan Lee*

## Project Description

As Eagle Scouts that are required to know what actions to take in case of medical emergency,
we believe that everyone should have some knowledge on what to do in any medical situation.
With this, we have decided to create an application that provides the user with a quick diagnosis
of possible medical problems that they could have based on the symptoms that they give.
Using databases full of medical problems and symptoms, we have combined this with Java to analyze
the symptoms and give a diagnosis, and later on, to be able to contact 911 as quick as possible.

## How To Use The Project

Input the symptom that the patient is experiencing.\
The user will receive an output with a diagnosis and further instructions they should take.

## Future Plans

Being able to use SymptAid Response as a mobile application.\
Improve the design of the UI.
